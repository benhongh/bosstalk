![But why?](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/976/824/913.gif "But Why?")

Everyone has a boss.
Rather than taking sh_ts from your boss day in and day out,
we figure it's better to just share your conversation, 
and turn that negative energy into something we can all have a laugh of.
So we have created this website 
and hope that one day we may just get a Nobel Peace Prize.
